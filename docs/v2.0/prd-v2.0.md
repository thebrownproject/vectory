**Product Vision:**

A self-hosted or SaaS platform that lets users upload documents, automatically extract and chunk their content using AI, embed into a vector database, and then search or chat with their own data.

**Core Idea:**

Empower teams and individuals to instantly search, summarize, or query their private documents through intuitive drag-and-drop uploads and contextual search/chat interfaces.

**Value Proposition:**

Fast, private, customizable knowledge search without manual preprocessing or complex setup.

---

### 2. Target Users

- **Developers**: Want local or API-based access (via MCP).
- **Professionals/Teams**: Need internal search or summarization of documents.
- **Researchers**: Manage and query document collections for insights.
- **Early Adopters**: Tech-savvy users exploring AI-RAG systems.

---

### 3. User Stories

- As a **user**, I want to sign up and create a project (“stack”) so I can organize documents by topic or client.
- As a **user**, I want to drag and drop PDF, DOCX, and TXT files, so the system automatically parses text using Docling.
- As a **user**, I want to see uploaded document metadata (title, size, date added).
- As a **user**, I want to search by phrase or concept and see relevant paragraphs from all documents.
- As a **Pro user**, I want to chat directly with my data using an AI assistant that references my Chroma database.
- As a **developer**, I want to connect my own MCP client to run queries on my vector database for free-tier access.

### 4. Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Authentication & User Management**
   - Supabase Auth for sign-up/login (email + OAuth later).
   - RLS for per-user data isolation.
   - Freemium limits: 1 stack, 5 documents, 50MB max total size.
2. **Document Upload & Processing**
   - Docling automates text extraction and layout analysis.
   - Status tracking (upload → parse → embed complete).
   - Supabase Storage holds raw files.
   - Metadata stored in Supabase Postgres (document title, stack, processing state).
3. **Chunking & Embedding**
   - LangChain pipeline handles chunking + embedding via OpenAI or local models.
   - Stores in self-hosted ChromaDB per user stack.
4. **Vector Search**
   - Simple semantic search endpoint using Chroma retrieval.
   - Query returns top-N passages with metadata.
5. **Chat Integration (Pro Tier)**
   - React-based Chat UI using **OpenAI ChatKit**.
   - System prompts fed with retrieved chunks before generation.
   - History and usage logs written to Supabase.
6. **MCP Server Access (Free Tier)**
   - Deploy self-hostable endpoint for users to connect their agents to their collection.

### 6. Success Metrics

- Free-tier conversion rate to paid (10% goal by month 3).
- Average time from upload to searchable document under 30 s.
- <1 s average search response time on 100 documents.
- 95%+ positive user feedback on chat relevance.

---

### 7. Roadmap (MVP → Pro)

**Phase 1 (MVP)** – 4 weeks

- Supabase auth + storage setup
- File upload + Docling parsing
- Basic chunk + embed + Chroma search
- Freemium tier enforcement

**Phase 2 (Pro release)** – 8 weeks

- ChatKit integration
- MCP connector
- Payment + billing engine
- Multi-stack support
