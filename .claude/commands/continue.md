description: Resume development from where you left off
---

You are resuming development on the Vectory project. Follow these steps to get oriented and continue work:

## Step 1: Read Project Context

Read the following files to understand the project:
- `prd.md` - Project requirements and scope
- `tasks.md` - Development roadmap and task status
- `development-notes.md` - Session notes and important decisions

## Step 2: Check Git Status

Run the following git commands:
- `git branch --show-current` - Check current branch
- `git status --short` - Check for uncommitted changes

## Step 3: Analyze Current State

Based on `tasks.md`:
1. Identify the current phase (look for the phase that has incomplete tasks)
2. Find the last completed task (marked with `[x]`)
3. Find the next pending task (marked with `[ ]`)
4. Determine which phase branch you should be on (e.g., `feature/phase-2-vector-adapter`)

## Step 4: Validate Branch Consistency

Check if current git branch matches the expected branch for the current phase:
- If working on Phase 2 tasks, should be on `feature/phase-2-*` branch
- If working on Phase 3 tasks, should be on `feature/phase-3-*` branch
- etc.

If branch doesn't match, warn the user.

## Step 5: Present Summary

Display a clear summary in this format:

```
üìç Development Context

**Current Branch:** [branch name]
**Current Phase:** [Phase X - Name]

**Progress:**
‚úÖ Last completed: [Task ID - Description]
‚è≠Ô∏è  Next task: [Task ID - Description]

**Git Status:**
[Any uncommitted changes or "Working tree clean"]

**Important Notes from development-notes.md:**
- [Any critical TODOs or blockers from latest session]

---

Ready to proceed with [Next Task ID]?
```

## Step 6: Wait for User Confirmation

After presenting the summary, ask: "Would you like to proceed with [Next Task ID]?"

Do NOT proceed until the user confirms.

## Step 7: Fetch Documentation with Context7 MCP (After User Confirms)

**IMPORTANT:** Only execute this step AFTER the user has confirmed they want to proceed.

Before writing any code for the next task:
1. Identify which libraries/packages the next task will use (based on task description in tasks.md)
2. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation for each library
3. Focus the documentation query on the specific functionality needed for the task

**Example for different tasks:**
- **Embeddings task**: Fetch OpenAI Python SDK docs (topic: "text embeddings generation")
- **FastAPI endpoint task**: Fetch FastAPI docs (topic: "file upload multipart forms")
- **React component task**: Fetch React/Next.js docs (topic: "file upload components")

**Process:**
1. Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to find the library
2. Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` with specific topic and ~3000 tokens
3. Review the documentation before writing any code
4. Apply best practices from the docs to write concise, clean code

Then begin working on the task following the workflow in CLAUDE.md.

## Additional Checks

- If there are uncommitted changes, warn the user before proceeding
- If on `main` branch but tasks show an active phase, suggest creating the feature branch
- If all tasks in current phase are complete, suggest merging and starting next phase
